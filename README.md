## Info
This is the *unstable* branch for William's Console, this is made to ensure the best possible performance with Re-Console's Adrenaline configuration files.

## When do updates happen?
I usally update whenever I have spare time, which I have a lot of. I always seek for improvements for performance and stabilty wise, so expect it to be a bit slow.
