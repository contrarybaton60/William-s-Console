## Features
Mods such as Legacy4J, which has near 100% parity with the old Console Editions we all know and love. Now including other mods like Adorn, Comforts, Traverse, and more! refreshing the game in nice ways.

## When do updates happen?
I usally update whenever I have spare time, which I have a lot of. I always seek for improvments for performance and stabilty wise, so expect it to be a bit slow.
