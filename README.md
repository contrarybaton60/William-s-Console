# William's Console

William's Console is a hard fork of Re-Console and introduces numerous subtle enhancements ontop of it, improving the overall experience. These enhancements include ambient sounds, sleeping bags, eating animations and sound effects, additional particle effects, improved minecarts, shaders, and various other refinements. These mods serve to elevate the game to a more refined and immersive level, all the while upholding the classic Console Edition style that Re-Console achieves.
