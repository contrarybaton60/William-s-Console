## Info
This is the *unstable* branch for William's Console, this is made to ensure the best possible performance with Re-Console's Adrenaline configuraion files.

## When do updates happen?
I usally update whenever I have spare time, which I have a lot of. I always seek for improvments for performance and stabilty wise, so expect it to be a bit slow.

## Special Thanks
- [omoso](https://modrinth.com/user/omoso) for giving me permision for fork off of Re-Console
- [Wilyicaro](https://modrinth.com/user/wilyicaro) for making the Legacy4J mod.
- [Permdog](https://modrinth.com/user/Permdog99) who made the Legacy Mipmaps mod.
- And all other mod devs who made this project posible.
- This modpack uses some of the Simply Optimized configuration files.
