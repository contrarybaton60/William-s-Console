After some trial and error, I have realized Re-Console needs the SDL2 framework to run, which is not installed on macOS by default. Here is a quick tutorial to do so:

1. Install the latest release here (for mac, it will be the .dmg installer): https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.3
2. Run the installer
3. Open a new finder window, and in the upper left-hand portion of the screen, click go, go to folder, and enter this path: /Library/Frameworks
4. Drag the SDL2.framework folder from the installer to the framework directory
5. Launch ReConsole using the launcher of your choice. Click OK on the promts until your instance crashes
6. Open System Settings, go to Privacy & Security, and scroll down to where you see "SDL2.framework" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.. Click Allow Anyway.
You can now launch ReConsole!
